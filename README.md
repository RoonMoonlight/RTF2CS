***Roon's TF2C Server (AKA RTF2CS)*** is the continuation of the RTF2CS/Project Unison and RTF2S. It is planned to arrive at the release of Steam version.

## Server List

## Features
* **[The New-Old Weapons Pack!](https://gamebanana.com/mods/40389) are included, adding tons of your weapons into your loadout bag.**
* **Located in NA Central.** Unfortunately the Asia server is discontinued due to lack of popularity. But we will be adding Asia server if there is popular demand from asian TF2C players.
* **Custom weapons and maps are automatically downloaded from the CDN.** You don't have to download files manually.
* **Simplicity focused.** No MariaDB, and complex and unnecessary things are included so you don't have to worry about server crash.
* **Configuration and plugins are on the repository.** So you can make custom server by yourself using same templates.
